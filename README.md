## Installation

Just cloning or downloading the project. Other option is to use the online version

## Usage

- Check and try the usage of [SpringSchoolApiRest](https://springschoolapirest.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/) using Open API and Swagger UI hosted in [Render](https://render.com/). But be quick, free stuff doesn't last long :wink:

If not, ensure you add the path /api/ to your requests in Postman, Httpiness or similar program

```
** Get a List of all teachers **
https://springschoolapirest.onrender.com/api/teachers

**  Get a teacher according to an Id **
https://springschoolapirest.onrender.com/api/teachers/1
```

- Maybe you prefer to open it from you favorite IDE

- Or you could use the jar file hosted in /target. For this, run this command from the folder and send your HTTP request to localhost:8080

```
java -jar school-api-rest-1.0.jar
```

Example of URL for and HTTP GET request in local environment

```
**  Get a student according to an Id **
localhost:8080/api/students/2
```

- Also, you can use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Whether it is your flavor, first, from the inside of the main project folder, build the image using the settings from Dockerfile

```
docker build -t spring-school-api:latest .
```

Then create and run a container with, for instance, these settings

```
docker run --name spring-school-api-container -p 8080:8080 -d spring-school-api
```
