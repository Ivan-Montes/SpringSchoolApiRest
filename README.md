## Installation

You could Use the jar file hosted in /target or clone the whole project

## Usage

Check and try the usage of [SpringSchoolApiRest](https://springschoolapirest.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/) using Open API and Swagger UI hosted in [Render](https://render.com/). But be quick, free stuff doesn't last long :wink:

If not, ensure you add the path /api/ to your requests in postman, as the typical web developers does (or try hard and use VIM :muscle::muscle: ):

```
** Get a List of all teachers **

```
